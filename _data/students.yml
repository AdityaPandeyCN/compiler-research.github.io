    This project has the goal to find and decrease boost dependencies in CMSSW.
    Modern C++ introduced a lot of new features that were only available through
    boost packages. Thus, some boost code can be replaced with similar C++
    standard library features. Using standard features is a good practice, this
    project will move the CMSSW codebase in that direction.

    ROOT has several features that interact with libraries and require implicit
    header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing data on disk,
    or user actions at the prompt. Exposing the full shared library descriptors
    to the interpreter at runtime translates into an increased memory footprint.
    ROOT’s exploratory programming concepts allow implicit and explicit runtime
    shared library loading. It requires the interpreter to load the library
    descriptor. Re-parsing of descriptors’ content has a noticeable effect on
    runtime performance. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of
    the same header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of
    the C++ Code. C++ Modules have been implemented for Unix and OS X systems
    already and it is expected that with next release of ROOT, C++ modules will
    be default on OS X. This project aims to extend the C++ Modules support for
    Windows, by implementing compatible solutions to the UNIX baseline and also
    display corresponding performance results.
