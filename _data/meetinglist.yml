      speaker: "Oliver Schulz, Max-Planck-Institut für Physik"
      description: |
        Julia can directly call C++ via the Cxx.jl package. This enables is to
        use basically all of ROOT's capabilities directly from Julia, including
        reading/writing TFiles and user ROOT's GUI features. I'll present some
        past experiences and practical examples of Julia/ROOT interaction.

    - title: "ORC 2021 -- Recent developments and future work in LLVM's JIT APIs"
      speaker: "Lang Hames, Apple"
      description: |
        LLVM’s On Request Compilation (ORC) APIs provide a foundation for
        building in-memory and just-in-time compilers by re-using existing
        static compilers. This re-use is enabled by appending a new linking
        step to the standard compiler pipeline to patch the compiler output into
        the executing process. The ORC APIs support concurrent compilation, lazy
        compilation, and linking of code across process boundaries and even
        across architectures. The ORC APIs are already used in several open
        source projects including PostgreSQL, Cling, Julia, and the Swift
        interpreter; and they remain under active development with new features
        added frequently. This talk will provide an overview of the ORC APIs and
        recent developments, as well as demos and pointers to example code.

        Sylvain Corlay from QuantStack talks about C++ in Jupyter Notebooks
        using the Xeus-Cling. Xeus-Cling is a Cling-based notebook kernel which
        delivers interactive C++. Sylvain makes a deep dive in topic outlining
        some of the specific challenges and requirements.

        Simeon Ehrig from Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) shared his
        work with us recently. In his talk he gives insights about interactive
        CUDA using the C++ interpreter Cling. He shows several exciting examples
        in the area of dynamic execution without loss of state where we can
        "checkpoint" the execution state, add specific data analysis and reuse
        the previous computations.
